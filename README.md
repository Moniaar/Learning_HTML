# Learning_HTML
This repositry will contain my documentaion for both HTML and CSS whenever I have the free time to do so.
1. index.html: is the file that holds everything as a base index for your html main ideas, starting from the font sizes and designes along the page, to the stylesheet that holds the css file inside another directory.
2. HTML_and_CSS_Design: this is a template made after watching a tutorial by Osama Elzero channel on youtube and was highly influnced by his instructions and guidance there.
